# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior when using Tailwind CSS classes with flexbox.  Two divs, styled with different background colors, do not render correctly side-by-side as expected.  The solution provides a corrected implementation.

## Bug
The bug is in `bug.html` and shows the divs stacking vertically instead of horizontally. 

## Solution
The solution is provided in `bugSolution.html` and demonstrates the correct usage of Tailwind classes to achieve the desired horizontal layout.  See the README for details.
